Hi everyone, my name is Paula! I graduated from Berkeley in the spring with a B.A. in Public Health and a minor in Data Science and am now studying Epidemiology and Biostatistics in the 4+1 MPH. I am passionate about informatics and the use of technology to improve patient advocacy. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, cooking with friends, and hiking around the Bay. Feel free to reach out about questions you may have with Datahub or anything else. I'm looking forward to working with everyone this semester! 

Also fluent in: Spanish
